			<p>Updated on: January 26, 2021</p>
			<p>Became effective on: January 26, 2021</p>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Thank you for your choice of Wushen Game(hereafter referred to as "we" or "us"; in the Guidelines)! In
				addition to Wushen Game Privacy Policy and Wushen Game License and Service Agreement, through the
				Wushen Game Privacy Protection Guidelines ("Guidelines"), we will further elaborate on how we collect,
				use, store and share your personal information when you are playing Wushen Game, as well as the relevant
				rights you are entitled to. The Guidelines are part of the Wushen Game License and Service Agreement.
				The highlights are as follows:</p>
			<p><strong>&#8226; In order to provide you with game entertainment and to support the related player
					interaction, consumption and other services, we need to collect information such as your game
					history, device information, login data and others.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>&#8226; In order to better protect both the physical and the mental health of minors and
					facilitate a healthy access to the internet by minors, we may implement more stringent
					anti-addiction measures in addition to the national regulations on anti-addiction policies of online
					games. At the same time, we have been constantly developing and testing various new technologies to
					better protect the minors. For instance, in order to further improve the accuracy of real-name
					verification and to try best to prevent minors from impersonating the identity of others, we may
					enable face-recognition verifications in some games or for some users (subject to specific game
					strategies).</strong></p>
			<p><strong>&nbsp; The above-mentioned face-recognition verification mainly compares the user's real face
					information with the data sourced from the authoritative data platform of the police department. If
					the comparison results match, the verification is successfully passed, and a proper game time limit
					would be designated according to the actual category of the user’s age. If the comparison results do
					not match or the user refuses to go through the verification process, we will deem the user as a
					minor under 12 years old and enforce the corresponding anti-addiction supervision. The relevant
					verification data of face-recognition, upon encryption, is only used for comparison with the data
					from the authoritative data platform of the police department and will not be stored by us.</strong>
			</p>
			<p><strong>&#8226; You can manage your personal information and the relevant authorizations according to the
					provisions of the Guidelines.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>&#8226; We adopt a wide range of security measures to ensure that your personal information is
					protected under a reasonably safe manner.</strong></p>
			<p>By reading the full version of Wushen Game Privacy Protection Guidelines, you may learn more about
				the processing rules of personal information such as the correspondence between the types and the uses
				of personal information.</p>
